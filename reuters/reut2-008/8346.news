<DATELINE>    ATLANTA, March 23 - </DATELINE><BODY>IRT Property Co said it is in talks on
the issucne in Europe of 30 mln dlrs of 15-year two pct
debentures convertible into common stock at 23.50 dlrs per
share.
    It said investors would have the right to require the
company to redeem half of the issue during the 49th month of

It said the conversion price might be adjusted or the offering
discontinued based on fluctuations in the market price of IRT
common before distribution of the debentures.
