<TITLE>FRENCH INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION FALLS IN JANUARY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 23 - </DATELINE><BODY>French industrial production fell a
seasonally adjusted 1.98 pct in January after revised unchanged
output in December, the National Statistics Institute (INSEE)
said.
    The figure, which excludes construction and public works,
put the January index, base 1980, at 99 after 101 in December.
January output was 1.98 pct down on January 1986.
    INSEE, which from January changed its base year to 1980
from 1970, originally had December output down 2.2 pct on
November, using the old base year.
    INSEE said production in January was affected by rail
strikes and severely cold weather.
    It said output of gas and electricity was very high but
activity slowed on construction sites, in quarries and in
certain base industries.
