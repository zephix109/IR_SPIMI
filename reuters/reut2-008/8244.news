<TITLE>JAPAN SAYS IT TRYING TO EXPAND DOMESTIC DEMAND</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TAUPO, New Zealand, March 23 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japan has assured a meeting
of trade ministers it is making every effort to expand domestic
demand and restructure its economy.
    Japanese trade representative Tsomu Hata told an informal
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) meeting that, in
addition to demand boosting measures adopted last September, a
comprehensive economic program will be prepared after the
1987/88 budget is approved.
    Hata, speaking at the first session of the two-day meeting,
said agriculture is no exception to the goal of restructuring
the economy, but did not elaborate.
    Hata said protectionist pressures in the international
economy are as strong as ever, reflecting financial deficits,
payment imbalances and serious unemployment in many countries.
