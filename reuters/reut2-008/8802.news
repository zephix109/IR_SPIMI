<TITLE>FED MAY ADD RESERVES, ECONOMISTS SAY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 24 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Federal Reserve may intervene in
the government securities market to add reserves today, some
economists said, although others felt that the Fed was likely
to refrain from any action.
    Those who believed the Fed will intervene said it would
probably add temporary reserves indirectly via 1.5 to two
billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreements.
    But others noted the Fed's current add-need is not large.
They also expected the federal funds rate to edge lower.
    Fed funds, which averaged 6.21 pct on Monday, opened at
6-1/8 pct and remained at that level in early trading.
