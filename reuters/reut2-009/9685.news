<TITLE>PALO VERDE UNIT 3 GRANTED OPERATING LICENSE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WINTERSBURG, Ariz., March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>The United States Nuclear
Regulatory Commission granted a low-power operating license to
Unit 3 of the Palo Verde nuclear plant, plant's owners said.
    Owners of the Palo Verde plant include AZP Group's Arizona
Public Service Co unit, which holds a 29.1 pct interest, and
Southern California Edison &lt;SCE> and El Paso Electric Co, which
each own a 15.8 pct stake.
   The owners said the license will allow for fueling and
testing of up to five pct of the plant's power. Fueling will
begin in a few days, they said.
    The commission must review the results of the low-power
testing before it can approve full-power operation.
    The owners of plant said they expect to begin full-power
operation by the end of 1987.
