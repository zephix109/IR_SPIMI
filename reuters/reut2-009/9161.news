plans for a one-for-five bonus issue for both its "A" and "B"

net profits to 1.78 billion H.K. Dlrs.
    The company also announced final dividends of 44 cents per
"A" share and 8.8 cents per "B" share against 32.3 and 6.5 cents a

Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd &lt;CAPH.HKG> in line with the
floatation of the airline.
