<TITLE>INT'L MINERALS PROJECT TO BOOST HOG LEAN WEIGHT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NORTHBROOK, ILL., March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>International Minerals and
Chemical Corp said its board approved a 50 mln dlrs budget over
the next several years to build production facilities for a
newly developed product to be used to improve the lean weight
of hogs.
    The new product, porcine somatotropin (PST) is described as
a natural bio-synthetic protein that improves the lean weight
and rate of weight gain, as well as reduces the cost of feed
for market hogs, the company said.
    Specific details of the PST production project, including
sites for proposed facilities and engineering plans, were not
disclosed. International Minerals said it set a completion
target for the spring of 1989, by which time necessary Food and
Drug Administration approvals are expected to be obtained.
