<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>Abbey National, the second largest
building society in the U.K., Said it has arranged a one

    It said this is the largest such program to date for a
building society and the first to be denominated in U.S.
Dollars.
    Citicorp Investment Bank Ltd is lead manager and arranger
for the program and will act as a dealer, along with Shearson
Lehman Brothers International, Swiss Bank Corp International

    Abbey National has been very active in the international

law to tap the wholesale markets.
    The building society's general manager, finance, James

strategy of spreading its funding option from what has recently
been medium/long term into shorter term instruments.
