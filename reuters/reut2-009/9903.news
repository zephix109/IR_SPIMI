<TITLE>MADAGASCAR COCOA PRODUCTION ESTIMATED HIGHER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ANTANANARIVO, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Madagascar's cocoa production is
estimated 13 pct higher this year at 2,720 tonnes, up from
2,400 in 1986, Agriculture Ministry officials said.
    This improvement reflects the government's efforts over the
last seven years to extend existing cocoa plantations and plant
new higher yielding varieties, particularly at the northern tip
of the island, they said.
    Last year, Madagascar exported 2,189 tonnes of high quality
cocoa, up from 1,624 in 1985, the Trade Ministry said.
    This year's exports are estimated at 2,400 tonnes.
