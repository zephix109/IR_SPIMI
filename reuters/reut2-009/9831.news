<TITLE>TURKEY COULD APPLY FOR EC MEMBERSHIP BY EARLY MAY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Turkey's European Affairs Minister Ali
Bozer will arrive here on Saturday to set a date for his
country's long-planned application to join the European
Community (EC), expected by early May, diplomats said.
    The Turkish embassy here said an application was expected
"very soon" but gave no date. But sources close to the embassy
said the application for full EC membership would probably be
made in April, or at the latest, by the first week of May.
    Bozer, is due to meet Turkish Prime Minister Turgut Ozal in
London today to decide on the date of the application, they
added.
