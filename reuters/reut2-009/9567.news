<TITLE>ALABAMA UPGRADED IN BRUCELLOSIS PROGRAM</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>Alabama has advanced from a Class B
to a Class A rating in the eradication of cattle brucellosis
program, thus relieving some restrictions in the interstate
movement of cattle from the state, the U.S. Agriculture
Department said.
    To qualify for a Class A rating, a state must keep its herd
infection rate at or below 0.25 pct for 12 months.
    The change in Alabama's classification reduces the testing
and identification requirements for cattle moved interstate for
breeding purposes, to immediate slaughter or to quarantined
feedlots, USDA said.
    Brucellosis is an infectious bacterial disease that causes
abortion, reduced fertility and lower milk yields in cattle, it
noted.
