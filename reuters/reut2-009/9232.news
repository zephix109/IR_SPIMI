<TITLE>OLSON &lt;OLSN> TO HAVE LOSS FROM EGG UNIT SALE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SHERMAN OKAS, Calif., March 25 - </DATELINE><BODY>Olson Industries Inc said
it is in final negotiations on the sale of its remaining egg
operations and expects the sale to generate a charge of about
two mln dlrs against 1987 net income.
    The company said, however, that the sale will generate
substantial cash flow to pay off bank debt and improve working
capital, eliminate unmanageable effects on profits of the price
instability of the egg business and allow it to concentrate on
its plastics packaging business.
