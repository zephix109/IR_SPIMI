<TITLE>DAIMLER DISMISSES CURRENCY SPECULATION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, March 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>A spokesman for Daimler-Benz AG
&lt;DAIG.F> said that rumours the car-maker was suffering from
currency difficulties were "absolute rubbish."
    Like all major exporters Daimler undertakes currency
hedging but has no problems here, according to the spokesman,
contacted by telephone in Stuttgart.
    Daimler shares fell 17 marks yesterday in Frankfurt to a
year's low of 896 on the rumours and was quoted in pre-bourse
trading today around 890.
    A week ago Volkswagen AG &lt;VOWG.F> said it may have lost 480
mln marks on fraudulent currency hedging deals.
