<TITLE>ARGENTINA CROP WEATHER SUMMARY -- USDA/NOAA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Precipitation diminished over
Argentina's summer crop areas in the week ended March 14, the
U.S. Agriculture and Commerce Departments Joint Weather
Facility said.
    In its International Weather and Crop Summary, the agency
said crop areas in Cordoba, Santa Fe, and Buenos Aires received
only light scattered showers -- three to 13 millimeters.
     The beneficial drier weather allowed drying of fields for
summer crop harvesting, following February's heavy rainfall, it
said.
