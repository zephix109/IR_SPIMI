<TITLE>FHLBB APPROVES FUNDS TRANSFER TO DALLAS BANK</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Federal Home Loan Bank Board
said it voted to transfer one billion dlrs cash from the
Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp (FSLIC) to the Dallas
Federal Home Loan bank tomorrow to correct a collateral
deficiency.
    The infusion was needed because the value of collateral
behind FSLIC loans to savings and loan associations in the
region had declined, an FHLBB official said.
    The official said that as a result, auditors of the Dallas
bank, one of the 12 regional federal home loan banks, would be
able to give an unqualified opinion on the bank's condition.
