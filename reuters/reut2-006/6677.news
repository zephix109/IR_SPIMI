<TITLE>NEGOTIATORS PUT FINAL TOUCHES TO NEW RUBBER PACT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    GENEVA, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Rubber producing and consuming
countries, which agreed on the bases of a new International
Natural Rubber Agreement (INRA) last weekend, are now putting
the final touches to the future accord, delegates said.
    They said discussions are focusing on conditions for entry
into force of the new INRA. The present pact, which expires in
October, required that governments accounting for 80 pct of
world exports and 80 pct of world imports approved or ratified
the pact before it became operational.
    Delegates said figures now being floated range between 65
and 80 pct.
