<DATELINE>     La paz, march 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>a senior world bank official said the
lending agency planned to authorise almost 70 mln dlrs in new
credits to bolster the productive structure of bolivia's state
oil company ypfb this year.
     David knox, world bank vice-president for latin america,
said bolivia should invest in projects which would spur growth
following six consecutive years of economic contraction.
     Knox said the world bank supported the economic
stabilisation programme adopted by president victor paz
estenssoro.
     Knox said he had suggested to bolivian authorities that
they invest as much of their disposable resources as possible
in works "of rapid reaction, and which support the decision to
make the bolivian economy grow."
     Knox is to hold talks with paz estenssoro, as well as
private businessmen and other government ministers during his
visit.
