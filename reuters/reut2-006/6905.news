<TITLE>ARGENTINE OIL, GAS PRODUCTION FALL IN FEBRUARY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BUENOS AIRES, March 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Argentina's total oil and gas
production fell 9.4 pct in February to 2.78 mln cubic metres
from January's total of 3.11 mln cubic metres, the state oil
company Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales (YPF) reported.
    A YPF statement blamed the drop on momentary problems owing
to the summer season but gave no further details.
    February's production figure fell slightly short of YPF's
target figure of 2.90 mln cubic metres.
    Oil production totalled 1.76 mln cubic metres last month
and natural gas production 1.02 mln cubic metres, down from
1.95 and 1.15 mln cubic metres in January, respectively.
