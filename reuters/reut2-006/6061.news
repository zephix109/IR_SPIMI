<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker
said the U.S. opposes Soviet membership of the World Bank or

    Baker told a House foreign affairs subcommittee, "I think
our position is absolutely clear on that ... We do not support
and will not support Soviet membership in the World Bank or the
IMF."

unconditional."
