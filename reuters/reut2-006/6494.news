U.S. economic growth rate during the final quarter of 1986

    The Commerce Department said the rate of growth of the
Gross National Product in the October-December period was only
slightly less than a preliminary estimate of 1.3 pct made
earlier.
    At the same time, it said inflation, as measured by the GNP
price deflator, rose by 0.7 pct during the period.
