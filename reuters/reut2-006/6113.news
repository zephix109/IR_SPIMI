<DATELINE>    HOUSTON, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Oshman's Sporting Goods Inc said
earnings for the fourth quarter ended January 31 were affected
by the weak economies of Texas, Oklahoma and Louisiana,
resulting in a drop in net earnings to 5,415,000 dlrs or 92 cts
a share from 7,730,000 dlrs or 1.28 dlrs a share for the
year-ago quarter.
    The company also said sales on the West Coast were hurt by
late snows and poor skiing conditions.
    Same-store sales declined 3.2 pct for the quarter and 2.2
pct for the year.
    For the full year, Oshman's net earnings fell to 2,664,000
dlrs or 45 cts a share, from 8,536,000 dlrs or 1.40 dlrs a
share.

three.
    At year-end, the company said it was operating 188 Oshman's
stores and 27 Abercrombie and Fitch stores.
