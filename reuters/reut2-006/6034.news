<TITLE>K MART &lt;KM> ENDS TALKS TO SELL STORES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>K Mart Corp said recent talks to sell
65 remaining Kresge variety stores and their underlying real
estate to F.W. Woolworth Co &lt;Z> have ended.
    Robert Stevenson, K Mart vice president, told Reuters the
talks, which began about six weeks ago, ended. He declined to
give a reason.
    Kresge is the forerunner of what is now the K Mart chain.
The name was changed to K Mart in 1977, Stevenson said.
    "We're selling and buying real estate in our real estate
division, and Woolworth was interested in some of our
properties. The talks were of a casual nature," he said.
    The 65 Kresge stores that are scattered around the country
in downtown and suburban locations, he said.
    Stevenson said K Mart will continue to operate the stores.
"The stores are profitable. The only decision K Mart has made
is that we will continue to operate them," he said
    Kresge had been a nationwide chain of 900 variety stores.
