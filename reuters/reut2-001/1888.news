<TITLE>SURINAM GOVERNMENT TO DISCUSS ECONOMIC CRISIS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARAMARIBO, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Surinam's military government opens a
four-day congress tomorrow to discuss the country's deepening
economic crisis, the official Surinam News Agency reported.
    Acting Prime Minister Jules Wijdenbosch will open the
meeting which is being attended by government officials,
political leaders and heads of labor unions.
    Surinam's economy has suffered a sharp downturn in recent
months as a result of guerrilla activities led by former
soldier Ronny Brunswijk, who is seeking to overthrow the
government of Commander Desi Bouterse.
    The guerrillas have forced the shutdown of most of
Surinam's vital bauxite and aluminum industry, creating a
foreign exchange crisis and food shortages.
