<DATELINE>    ROME, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Italy's state-owned &lt;Banca Nazionale del

depositary receipts by BNL's London branch. They said the bonds

with foreign institutional investors.

on foreign stock exchanges with a view to future capital
increases through ordinary share issues, they said.
