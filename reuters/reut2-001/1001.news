<DATELINE>    BASLE, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Sandoz AG said it planned a joint venture
to produce herbicides in the Soviet Union.
    The company said it had signed a letter of intent with the
Soviet Ministry of Fertiliser Production to form the first
foreign joint venture the ministry had undertaken since the
Soviet Union allowed Western firms to enter into joint ventures
two months ago.
    The ministry and Sandoz will each have a 50 pct stake, but
a company spokeswoman was unable to give details of the size of
investment or planned output.
