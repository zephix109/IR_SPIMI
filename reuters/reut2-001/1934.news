Trading Corp will send a team to Japan next week to negotiate
an iron ore export contract for 1987/88 beginning April 1,
trade sources said.

around 23 mln tonnes a year, has asked India to reduce prices
from the current average of 18 dlrs a tonne, the sources said.

India next year if New Delhi fails to reduce the price," one
source said, but declined to give further details.
