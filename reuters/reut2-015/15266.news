<TITLE>AIRLINE FARE DISCLOSURE BILL PROPOSED IN SENATE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 8, Reuter - </DATELINE><BODY>Angered by late flights and
complicated restrictions on discount air fares, a senator has
introduced legislation to make airlines provide more details on
fares and schedules in their advertisements.
    Sen. Frank Lautenberg, the bill's sponsor, said airline ads
now are often misleading because they do not give prospective
passengers enough facts about discount fares.
    "Air travelers are lured by low advertised fares which
simply aren't available," the New Jersey Democrat said in a
statement. "It's the old bait and switch."
    Airline advertisements usually say discount seats are
limited, but Lautenberg said more information was needed.
