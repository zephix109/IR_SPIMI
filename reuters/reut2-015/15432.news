<TITLE>MIYAZAWA SAYS YEN STILL INSIDE PARIS RANGE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi
Miyazawa said the strengthening of the yen against the dollar
that has occurred since the Paris Agreement was within the
range agreed on in the Louvre discussions.
    "I would say that what has happened (to the yen) in the past
several weeks was not outside the range we agreed to in the
discussions in Paris," Miyazawa told a press conference
following the Group of Seven meeting here.
    He added that the current discussions were a "reaffirmation"
of that agreement, indicating that the "solidarity" that occurred
in Paris was still in place.
