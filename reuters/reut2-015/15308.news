<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>National Distillers and Chemical Corp
said it signed a definitive agreement to sell its spirits
division for 545 mln dlrs to James Beam Distilling Co, a unit
of American Brands Inc &lt;AMB>.
    The sale of the spirits division was made under the
company's previously announced plan to sell its spirits and

would be for 545 mln dlrs plus the assumption of liabilities.

580 mln dlrs, American Brands said. National's spirits brands
include Gilbey's gin and vodka, DeKuyper Liqueurs and Windsor
Supreme Canadian Whisky.
