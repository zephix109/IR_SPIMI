<TITLE>NASD SETS FILING DEADLINES FOR BROKERS/DEALERS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>The National Association of
Securities Dealers Inc said it set April 15 as the deadline for
government securities brokers and dealers to submit
applications for registration under new rules.
    It said the rules apply to unregulated brokers and dealers,
who must be registered with the Securities and Exchange
Commission by July 25.
    NASD said it could guarantee brokers and dealers would meet
the July 25 deadline if it received application materials by
April 15. After April 15, it said it will make every effort to
meet the July 25 deadline, but could not guarantee it.
