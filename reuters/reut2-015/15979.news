<TITLE>WESTINGHOUSE ELECTRIC &lt;WX> OPTIMISTIC FOR YEAR</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PITTSBURGH, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Westinghouse Electric Corp chairman
Douglas Danforth said he was encouraged by first quarter
results for fiscal 1987, and said the company was positioned to
capitalize on the economy's modest growth for the rest of the
year.
    "I am encouraged by the continuing improvement in
earnings," Danworth said. "The first quarter met our
expectations."
    Westinghouse recorded net income for the first quarter of
151.6 mln dlrs, or 1.05 dlrs per share, on revenues of 2.32
billion dlrs.
    Danworth attributed the results to an increase in the
operating profit in the energy and advanced technology,
industries and commerical segments.
