<TITLE>U.S. TAX INCREASE PROPOSED ON BEER AND WINE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Rep. Anthony Beilenson, D-Cal, said
he introduced legislation to triple the federal excise taxes on
beer and on two types of wine which have the least alcohol.
    His bill would raise the tax on beer from nine dlrs to 27
dlrs per 31-gallon barrel, an increase of about 32 cents per
six pack. The tax on the two types of wine would go from 17
cents to 51 cents per gallon and from 67 cents to 2.01 dlrs per
gallon respectively, he said in a statement.
    "Raising the tax rates on beer and wine is an entirely
justifiable means of reducing the deficit. It would also
modestly discourage excessive drinking," Beilenson said.
