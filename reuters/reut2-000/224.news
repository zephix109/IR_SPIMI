<TITLE>TAIWAN OFFSHORE BANKING ASSETS RISE IN JANUARY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TAIPEI, Feb 27 - </DATELINE><BODY>The combined assets of Taiwan's offshore
banking units (obu) rose to 6.28 billion U.S. Dlrs at end-
January from 6.21 billion in December and 6.34 billion in
January 1986, the central bank said.
    A bank official told Reuters the increase came mainly from
increased local obu borrowings from their Asian counterparts.
    He said the assets, held by 15 foreign and local banks,
were mainly in U.S. Dollars with the remainder in certificates
of deposit and bonds. About 90 pct of the assets came from Asia
and the rest from North America and Europe, he added.
