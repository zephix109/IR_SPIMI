<TITLE>SOUTH KOREA TO HOLD CURRENT ACCOUNT SURPLUS DOWN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SEOUL, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>South Korea plans to take steps to keep
its 1987 current account surplus below five billion dlrs,
Economic Planning Board Minister Kim Mahn-je said.
    Kim told reporters the government would repay loans ahead
of schedule and encourage firms to increase imports and
investment abroad to prevent the current account surplus from
rising too quickly.
    Last year South Korea's current account surplus was 4.65
billion dlrs. It widened to 622 mln dlrs in January from 484
mln in December and compared with a deficit of 334 mln in
January 1986, Bank of Korea figures show.
