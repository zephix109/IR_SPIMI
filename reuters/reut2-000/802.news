<TITLE>CANADA GOVERNMENT SPENDING TO RISE 3.8 PCT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    OTTAWA, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The federal government's expenditures
will rise 3.8 pct in the fiscal year beginning April 1 to
110.14 billion dlrs from 107.01 billion dlrs in fiscal 1987,
the Treasury Board said.
    The board noted the growth in the main estimates is the
lowest since 1962, and below last year's 3.9 pct increase.
    After inclusion of two special accounts, an unemployment
insurance fund and a grain stabilization fund, total
expenditures amount to 122.55 billion dlrs, the same as the
estimate in the government's budget last month. The budget also
estimated a deficit of 29.3 billion dlrs for fiscal 1988.
