<TITLE>HOUSTON OIL &lt;HO> RESERVES STUDY COMPLETED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HOUSTON, Feb 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Houston Oil Trust said that independent
petroleum engineers completed an annual study that estimates
the trust's future net revenues from total proved reserves at
88 mln dlrs and its discounted present value of the reserves at
64 mln dlrs.
    Based on the estimate, the trust said there may be no money
available for cash distributions to unitholders for the
remainder of the year.
    It said the estimates reflect a decrease of about 44 pct in
net reserve revenues and 39 pct in discounted present value
compared with the study made in 1985.
