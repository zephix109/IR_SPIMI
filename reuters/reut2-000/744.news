<TITLE>U.S. TROOPS GET COST-OF-LIVING INCREASE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, MARCH 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger
ordered an increase in cost-of-living allowances for many U.S.
military personnel abroad because of the decreased value of the
dollar against foreign currencies, the Pentagon said.
    The allowances are expected to rise between 10 and 20 per
cent in many areas beginning this month, the Pentagon said..
    Weinberger also is providing for some family members of
financially-pressed troops to fly home from West Germany,
Japan, Italy and Spain on military transports if they desire.
    He said in a statement to the military that the
cost-of-living increases "will help keep your overseas
purchasing power close to your stateside counterparts."
