<TITLE>ROSPATCH &lt;RPCH> TO RESPOND TO DIAGNOSTIC &lt;DRS></TITLE>
<DATELINE>     GRAND RAPIDS, Mich., March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Rospatch Corp said it will
have a news release later in response to today's acquisition
bid by Diagnostic Retrieval Systems Inc for 22 dlrs a share.
    Rospatch earlier requested its stock be halted in over the
counter trading, last trade 24-1/8.
    Diagnostic said its bid was for a total 53 mln dlrs through
a cash tender offer for all, but not less than 51 pct of
Rosptach outstanding common.
    For its fourth-quarter ended December 31, 1986, Rospatch
reported net loss 2,649,000 or 1.10 dlrs a share compared a
loss of 627,500 or 35 cts profit for the 1985 period.
    In December the Brookehill Group in New York said it had
9.7 pct stake. J.A. Parini, Rospatch chief executive, responded
on January eight by saying the investment was a vote in
confidence in the company.
