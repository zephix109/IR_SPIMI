<DATELINE>    LOS ANGELES, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Neutrogena Corp said it may purchase
up to 100,000 shares of its outstanding common stock from time

issue of employee stock options.

outstanding.
    It said the shares that may be purchased and those
currently outstanding will be adjusted to reflect a
three-for-two stock split effective March two.
