<DATELINE>    ABU DHABI, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Deputy oil ministers from six Gulf
Arab states will meet in Bahrain today to discuss coordination
of crude oil marketing, the official Emirates news agency WAM

of last Sunday's agreement in Doha by Gulf Cooperation Council
(GCC) oil ministers to help each other market their crude oil.

Organiaation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and some
