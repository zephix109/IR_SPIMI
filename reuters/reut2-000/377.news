<TITLE>ALCAN TO CLOSE WEST GERMAN ALUMINIUM SMELTER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ESCHBORN, West Germany, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Alcan Aluminiumwerke
GmbH>, a subsidiary of Alcan Aluminium Ltd &lt;AL.N> of Canada,
said it plans to close its aluminium smelter in Ludwigshafen at
the end of June.
    A spokesman said Alcan was closing the smelter, with annual
capacity of 44,000 tonnes and 320 employees, because of high
electricity costs and the low world market price of aluminium.
    Alkan had said earlier this year it would close half the
plant's capacity but decided to shut down completely when talks
with potential cooperation partners failed, the spokesman said.
He declined to name the other companies involved in the talks.
