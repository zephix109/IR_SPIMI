<TITLE>CBT SOYPRODUCT FUTURES HIGHER IN EARLY TRADE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>CBT soyproduct futures traded higher
early in sympathy with the unexpected strength in soybeans,
with soyoil up 0.13 to 0.16 cent per lb and soymeal 0.40 to
1.00 dlr per ton higher, traders said.
    A mostly steady tone in overseas vegetable oils and feeds
markets underpinned initial values here, they added.
    A local professional house seen buying July soybeans also
bought July soyoil, with Produce Grain a buyer of September,
pit brokers said. Continental Grain and E.F. Hutton bought July
soymeal, with sellers scattered and small-lot, they said.
