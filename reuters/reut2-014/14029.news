<TITLE>N.Y. COFFEE FUTURES SLIGHTLY HIGHER, THIN EARLY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>N.Y. coffee futures were marginally
firmer midmorning, trading in ranges of no more than 0.50 cent.

range of 102.00 to 102.50 cents. July was up 0.15 at 104.15

roaster interest or producer selling.
