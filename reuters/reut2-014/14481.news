<TITLE>U.S. GOLD FUTURES END STRONGER, NEAR DAY'S HIGHS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Comex gold futures closed stronger and
near the day's highs, underpinned by a buoyant silver market,
brokers said.
    Silver again set the pace for the precious metals. Silver
posted a sharp rise on continued speculative purchases amid
hopes it would soon hit seven dlrs an ounce in the May
contract. Silver finished near session highs, analysts noted.
    Gold for delivery in June settled at 426.20 dlrs an ounce,
up 3.60 dlrs and just slightly under a day's high of 426.50
dlrs. Gold bullion rose to 422.25/3.25 dlrs from 418.10/60 dlrs
yesterday. Other contracts rose 3.60 to four dlrs.
