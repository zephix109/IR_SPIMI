<TITLE>SWEDISH INDUSTRY SEES HIGHER 1987 PRODUCTION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    STOCKHOLM, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Swedish industry expects a rise in
both production and exports during this year, with engineering
and forest companies forecasting the largest increases, a
survey by the National Institute for Economic Research showed.
    The government institute said in the survey -- of 2,000
manufacturing companies -- that industry this year planned to
reduce both raw material and finished goods inventories.
    It said domestic demand was expected to be mainly unchanged
but that exports should rise significantly. The number of firms
operating at full capacity fell slightly, however, in the first
quarter, said the report, which gave no figures.
