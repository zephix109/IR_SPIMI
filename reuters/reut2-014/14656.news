<TITLE>SENATE EXTENDS DAIRY COMMISSION REPORT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Senate approved legislation to
extend until March 31, 1988 the date for the National
Commission on Dairy Policy to report on the federal milk price
support program and the dairy industry.
    The report is to recommend whether the Agriculture
Department should have continued authority to reduce the milk
price support level.
    The one year extension was required due to delays in
setting up the commission.
