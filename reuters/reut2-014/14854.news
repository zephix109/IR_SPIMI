<DATELINE>    PEKING, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>China's industrial output rose 14.1 pct
in the first quarter of 1987 against the same 1986 period, the

with a target of seven pct for the whole of 1987, was "rather
high" but the base in the first quarter of 1986 was on the low
side. Industrial output grew 4.4 pct in the first quarter of
