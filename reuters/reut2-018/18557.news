<TITLE>FOUR SUGAR CARGOES SOLD TO CHINA YESTERDAY -TRADE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Four cargoes of raw sugar were sold to
China yesterday via the London trade to supplement the
country's current nearby buying programme, traders said.
    The sugar was reported sold at around 160 dlrs a tonne c
and f for July/August shipment or arrival in September, they
said.
    Some traders said recent Chinese purchases could total as
much as 300,000 tonnes, but others, while agreeing a heavy
volume had been taken, said an amount less than that figure was
involved.
    China was still believed to be in the market for more
sugar, traders said.
