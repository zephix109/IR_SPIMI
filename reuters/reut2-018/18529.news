<TITLE>YUGOSLAVIA SIGNS FOR 550 MLN ECU LOAN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BELGRADE, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Yugoslavia has signed up for a 550 mln
ECU loan from the European Community (EC), the  official Tanjug
news agency said.
    It said the agreement, which has yet to be ratified by the
12 EC countries and the European Parliament, was signed last
night in Brussels.
    The 20 year, 7.5 pct interest loan will be used to complete
the trans-Yugoslavia motorway and modernise the country's
railway network, the agency said.
    Yugoslavia's request for a 100 mln ECU grant was refused by
the EC, but will be discussed again, Tanjug added.
