<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Standard and Poor's Corp said it may
upgrade 100 mln dlrs of B-plus subordinated debt of Computer
Associates International Inc and 13 mln dlrs of B-minus
subordinated debt of UCCEL Corp.
    S and P cited a merger agreement between the two companies
which it believes will improve both firms' market positions as
well as complement each other's products and distribution.
    But S and P pointed out that duplicate product lines could
raise marketing difficulties and restrict sales.
    The agency will study improvements in the financial
condition and competitive position of the merged entity.
