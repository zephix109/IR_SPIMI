<TITLE>OLIN NIPPON-GAKKI'S YAMAHA IN PACT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    STAMFORD, Conn., June 15 - </DATELINE><BODY>Olin Corp said it formed a joint
venture with the Yamaha Group of Japan's Nippon-Gakki Co Ltd to
manufacture Olin's high-performance copper alloys in Japan for
sale in the Far East.
    The new firm, Yamaha-Olin Metal Corp, will share facilities
with Yamaha in Iwata, which are expected to come on line in the
third quarter of 1988., it said.
    The two companies first joined forces in August 1983 when
Yamaha agreed to process and market one of Olin's alloys. The
agreement led to a 1985 reroll agreement that involved a number
of alloys, it said.
