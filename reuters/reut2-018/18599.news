<TITLE>RPT - OPPOSITION TO EC OILS TAX INTACT - MINISTER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LUXEMBOURG, June 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>A minority group of European
Community countries strong enough to block the adoption of a
tax on vegetable and marine oils and fats is still intact after
the EC Commission proposed changes to its proposals earlier
today, British agriculture minister John MacGregor told
journalists.
    He said Britain, West Germany, the Netherlands and Denmark
continue to oppose the tax after the Commission proposed making
it temporary and promising compensation to any third countries
whose exports suffered.
