<TITLE>DANISH RESERVES RISE 10.5 BILLION CROWNS IN MAY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    COPENHAGEN, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Denmark's net official reserves rose
to 60.629 billion crowns in May from 48.380 billion in April,
against 39.481 billion in May 1986, the Central Bank said in
its monthly balance sheet report.
    Total net reserves, including reserves held by commercial
and major savings banks and corrected for exchange rate
adjustments, rose to 58.373 billion crowns in May from 47.835
billion in April, against 32.443 billion in May 1986.
    The Bank said in a statement that public loan transactions
accounted for net capital import of 0.1 billion crowns in May,
with net registered private capital imports of 9.1 billion.
    "Of this, the net sale of Danish crown bonds to other
countries totalled about 2.5 billion crowns. There was balance
between the purchase and sale of foreign securities," the
statement added.
    The Central Bank said that figures for private bank
reserves and registered capital movements were provisional and
there was no estimate yet of unregistered movements.
    "It is therefore not possible on this basis to draw
conclusions about the developments of the external current
account," the statement added.
