<TITLE>CBS/FOX VIDEO SEES HIGHER 1987 REVENUES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>CBS/Fox Video Co, an equal partnership of
CBS Inc &lt;CBS> and 20th Century-Fox Film Corp, expects revenues
for 1987 to exceed 400 mln dlrs, up from 361 mln dlrs last
year, President James Fifield said in an interview.
    Despite a leveling out of video recorder sales, Fifield
sees strong international business for the producer and
marketer of prerecorded videocassettes. He also said expansion
into non-theatrical products is bolstering results.
    Fifield was in Chicago to attend the summer Consumer
Electronics Show.
    CBS/Fox Video projects the industry will sell about 116 mln
units with a total manufacturers value of 3.3 billion dlrs.
    Fifield told Reuters his company will introduce "at least
20 of our best titles" in the fall to accommodate the new
Compact Disc-Video system.
    He also said CBS/Fox will support the new S-VHS, or Super
VHS high-resolution format with titles to match demand.
