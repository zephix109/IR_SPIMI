<TITLE>JAPAN TRUCK MAKERS TO CURB EXPORTS TO NORTH KOREA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, June 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>All four Japanese makers of large trucks
will stop exports to North Korea following the issue of
Japanese government guidance, company spokesmen told Reuters.

concern that North Korea was using Japanese-made trucks as
missile launching pads, they said.
    &lt;Nissan Diesel Motor Co Ltd> shipped 156 vehicles including
large and mid-sized trucks and buses to North Korea in 1986
while Isuzu Motors Ltd &lt;ISUM.T> exported more than 100 six to
eight-tonne trucks in 1986, company spokesmen said.
