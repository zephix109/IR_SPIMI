<DATELINE>    THE HAGUE, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Aid donors to Indonesia pledged a
total of 3.15 billion dlrs in fresh funds to Jakarta, a
statement issued after a two day meeting of the Inter
Governmental Group on Indonesia (IGGI) said.

steps to adjust to the changed economic environment," it said.

economic growth to create employment and called for policies
supporting growth of agriculture.
