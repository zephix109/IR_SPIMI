<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>RJR Nabisco Inc is raising 500 mln
dlrs via an issue of sinking fund debentures due 2017 yielding
8-3/4 pct, said lead manager Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.
    The debentures have an 8-5/8 pct coupon and were priced at

Moody's and A by Standard and Poor's. A sinking fund beginning
in 1998 to retire annually five pct of the debentures can be
increased by 200 pct at the company's option.
    Dillon, Read and Co Inc co-managed the deal.
