<TITLE>BALDRIGE WILL NOT OBJECT TO COMPUTERS FOR IRAN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige
said he would not object to the sale of computers to Iran
because the technology was that of U.S.-designed personal
computers developed ten years ago.
    "We have no reason not to ship it," Baldrige told reporters
after a Senate Banking Committee hearing on export controls.
    Baldrige said the Defense Department's objection that the
computers would be used in newspaper production was not a
reason to bar the granting of an export license. "This is not a
reason for denying it on foreign policy grounds," he said.
