<DATELINE>    BERNE, March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Swiss wholesale prices fell by 0.3 pct in
February, giving a drop of 4.3 pct from February 1986, the
Federal Office of Industry, Trade and Labour said.
    Prices had been unchanged in January, giving an annual drop
of 4.6 pct. They fell by 2.6 pct in the year to February 1986.
    The wholesale price index, base 1963, stood at 168.5 in

    The office said the fall was largely due to lower prices
for energy, raw materials and semi-finished goods. Consumer
goods prices rose slightly.
