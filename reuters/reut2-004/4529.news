<TITLE>KENYAN LEADER APPEALS FOR U.S. INVESTMENT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 12 - </DATELINE><BODY>President Reagan today had talks
with Kenyan President Daniel Arap Moi, who afterwards appealed
for more U.S. investment in Kenya and a deeper American
commitment to ending apartheid in South Africa.
    A senior administration official said that during the talks
Reagan stressed to Moi the importance of Kenya's maintaining
its high standards on human rights.
    The official said South Africa had not been a contentious
issue in the talks and that the two leaders had found a lot of
common ground on the issue. 
    The administration has practiced a policy of "constructive
engagement" with South Africa and accepted trade sanctions only
after they had been imposed by Congress.
