downgraded 1.7 billion dlrs of debt of United Technologies Corp
and subsidiaries.

A-plus from AA-minus the subordinated debt, of the parent and
units UT Financial Services Corp, UT Credit Corp, UT Finance
N.V. and Carrier Corp. A-1-plus commercial paper was affirmed.

reverse operational problems that hurt profitability and cash
