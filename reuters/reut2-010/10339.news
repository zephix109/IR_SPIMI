<TITLE>SOUTH AFRICAN MAIZE ESTIMATE CALLED CONSERVATIVE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>   JOHANNESBURG, March 27 - </DATELINE><BODY>The South African government's
maize production estimate of 7.8 mln tonnes for the current
year is "rather too conservative," leading grain and produce
merchants Kahn and Kahn Pty Ltd said.
    The company, in a detailed report, estimated the harvest as
high as 8.3 mln tonnes and said if this forecast is met the
ostensible surplus for export will be approximately 2.25 mln
tonnes.
    "This paradoxically is creating a problem for the Maize
Board," Kahn and Kahn said.
    It said the maize export price currently is depressed and
the board is "probably confronted with the necessity to maintain
or slightly increase the internal price of maize again...To
offset the ostensible loss which must be faced" on exporting
surplus amounts.
