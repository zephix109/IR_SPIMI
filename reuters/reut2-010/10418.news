<TITLE>AUSTRIA DOES NOT INTERVENE TO SUPPORT DOLLAR</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    VIENNA, March 27 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Austrian National Bank did not
intervene on the foreign exchange markets today to support the
dollar, deputy banking department chief Herbert Danzinger told
Reuters.
    He denied a suggestion by a dealer at one Vienna bank that
the National Bank had sold marks to support the U.S. Currency.
    Senior dealers at Creditanstalt and Girozentrale, Austria's
two largest banks, said they would have been aware of any
National Bank intervention. Any dollar purchases by the Bank
today were for purely day-to-day purposes, they said.
