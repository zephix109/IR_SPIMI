<TITLE>CYPRUS ACCUSES TURKEY OF AIRSPACE VIOLATIONS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NICOSIA, March 27 - </DATELINE><BODY>Cyprus has protested to the United
Nations over alleged airspace violations by the Turkish air
force, an official statement said.
    "On behalf of my government I wish to protest strongly the
above aggression and provocative actions of Turkey ..." Cyprus'
permanent representative at U.N. Headquarters said in a letter
to U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar.
    The protest came as NATO ambassadors met in emergency
session in Brussels to discuss rising tensions between Greece
and Turkey over a disputed area of the Aegean sea.
    The protest said Turkish jets flew over Cyprus yesterday
during an exercise of Turkish forces occupying north Cyprus.
    There was no immediate indication whether the alleged
overflight was connected with the Aegean crisis.
