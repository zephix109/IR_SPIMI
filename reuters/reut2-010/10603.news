<TITLE>ZAMBIA-TANZANIA HIGHWAY TO BE REHABILITATED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    DAR ES SALAAM, March 27 - </DATELINE><BODY>The main road between landlocked
Zambia and the Tanzanian port of Dar es Salaam is to be
rehabilitated at a cost of 109 mln dlrs, starting in December,
Willie Lyatu, the project coordinator in the Tanzanian Ministry
of Communications, said.
    The road runs parallel to the Chinese-built Tazara,
(Tanzania-Zambia) railway and is in bad condition.
    Lyatu said the government was currently evaluating 52 bids
by international contractors to rehabilitate 293.5 km of the
asphalt highway and 800 km of other trunk roads with a gravel
surface.
    The final list of contractors would be issued by the World
Bank, the project's main sponsor, at the end of April, he
added.
    The World Bank is contributing 50 mln dlrs to the project,
which is also being financed by the African Development Bank,
Norway and Denmark.
