<TITLE>BRAZIL OIL OUTPUT FELL IN FEBRUARY, USAGE UP</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    RIO DE JANEIRO, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Brazilian crude oil and
liquefied natural gas production fell to an average 583,747
barrels per day in February from 596,740 in the same 1986
month, the state oil company Petrobras said.
    The drop was due to operating problems in the Campos Basin,
the country's main producing area, where output was down to
346,011 bpd from 357,420, a Petrobras statement said.
    Consumption of oil derivatives totalled 1.14 mln bpd in
February, 16.7 pct up on February last year but down from the
record 1.22 mln bpd used in October last year. Use of alcohol
fuel in February was 208,600 bpd, 42 pct above February, 1986.
