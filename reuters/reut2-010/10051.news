<TITLE>OUTBOARD MARINE &lt;OM> SELLS 9.15 PCT DEBENTURES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Outboard Marine Corp is raising 100
mln dlrs via an offering of sinking fund debentures due 2017
yielding 9.15 pct, said lead manager Salomon Brothers Inc.
    The debentures have a 9-1/8 pct coupon and were priced at
99.75 to yield 146 basis points over comparable Treasury bonds.
Morgan Stanley co-managed the deal.
    The issue is non-refundable for 10 years.  A sinking fund
beginning in 1998 to retire annually five pct of the debt may
be increased by 200 pct at the company's option, giving it an
estimated minimum life of 13.85 years and maximum of 20.5
years. The debt is rated Baa-2 by Moody's and BBB-plus by S/P.
