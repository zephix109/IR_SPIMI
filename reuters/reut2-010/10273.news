<TITLE>NISSAN &lt;NSAN.T>, LANCER IN FORKLIFT AGREEMENT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 27 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japan's Nissan Motor Co Ltd said it and
&lt;Lancer Boss Group Ltd> of the U.K. Have agreed to cooperate on
the design and manufacture of forklift trucks.
    Under the accord, Lancer will start making jointly designed
trucks at its plant in Moosburg, West Germany, from July with
production reaching 300 three-wheeled and 100 four-wheeled
trucks by end-March 1988. Output will be doubled from April 1,
1988, a Nissan spokeswoman said.
    Nissan will start selling the three-wheelers under its
brand-name later this year and the four-wheelers from the end
of 1987, the company said.
    The equipment manufacturing agreement with Lancer is a
precaution against the European Community's (EC) January 1987
restriction on forklift truck exports to the EC, industry
sources said.
    Nissan exports 70 pct of its annual output of 16,000
forklift trucks, shipping 2,548 units to the EC in 1986, the
spokeswoman said.
