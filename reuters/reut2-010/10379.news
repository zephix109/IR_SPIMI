<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 27 - </DATELINE><BODY>Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone has told
his ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to come up with a
draft economic package in early April in time for his visit to
Washington starting on April 29, government officials said.
    Nakasone also instructed the government's Economic Planning

full-fledged economic plan to boost domestic demand as pledged
at last month's Paris currency stability accord by six
industrial countries, the officials told Reuters.
