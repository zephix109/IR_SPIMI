<TITLE>TURKEY LIFTS SURVEY SHIP ESCORT AS TENSION ABATES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ANKARA, March 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>Turkey pulled warships back from close
escort of its Sismik 1 survey ship as the threat of conflict
with Greece over oil rights in the Aegean Sea abated.
    The semi-official Anatolian Agency said naval vessels ended
their close protection of the ship as it continued work in
Turkish waters but were following it at a distance.
    Popular newspapers headlined what they saw as Turkish
resolve and international pressure forcing Greece to pull back
from planned exploration in disputed international waters.
    "Intense United States and NATO efforts bore fruit: Greece
will stay in its national waters," said the daily Gunes. The
top-selling Hurriyet topped its front page with: "Our resolute
stand made Greece see reason."
    But two newspapers, Cumhuriyet and Milliyet, noted in
identical headlines -- "Crisis Frozen" -- that the basic
disagreement over exploration rights remained unsolved.
    The confrontation eased after the Turkish government said
it had been assured Athens would not begin prospecting in
disputed waters.
