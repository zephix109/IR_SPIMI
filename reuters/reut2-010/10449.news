<DATELINE>  LONDON, March 27 - </DATELINE><BODY>Consumer members of the International
Cocoa Organization, ICCO, accepted a final buffer stock rules
compromise, "on the condition that producers also agree,"
consumer spokesman Peter Baron said.

compromise, which was put together yesterday by ICCO chairman
Denis Bra Kanon.
    Consumer delegates said they were optimistic the council
