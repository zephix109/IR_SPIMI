<TITLE>GLENWOOD RECALLS PRESCRIPTION DRUG LOT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TENAFLY, N.J., March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Glenwood Inc> said it is
recalling lot number 54238 of its potaba tablet (aminobenzoate
potassium), a prescription drug used mainly to treat
scleroderma, a painful skin thickening condition.
    It said 5,474 bottles of 100 tablets were distributed
nationwide. The product is made by Vitarine Pharmaceuticals of
Springfield Gardens, N.Y, exclusively under the Glenwood label.
    Glenwood said the recall is due to the pacakging of a
non-prescription tablet containing ammonium chloride and
caffeine with the potaba tablets.
    Only one lot number is involved, but the company said it
urges all potaba tablets purchased since January 1987 be 
discontinued if a lot number cannot be identified.
    It said potaba therapy requires about 24 tablets a day, and
in the mispackaged bottles patients could take excessively
large doses of caffeine and chloride which could produce rapid
heart beats, anxiety, and other ill health effects.
