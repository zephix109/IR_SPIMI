<DATELINE>    ARDMORE, Okla., March 27 - </DATELINE><BODY>Noble Affiliates Inc said it
found natural gas on Ship Shoal 80, located about 10 miles
offshore Louisiana in the Gulf of Mexico.
    The discovery well, Samedan Oil Corp's OCS-G 5537 Well
Number One, was drilled in 25 feet of water to a total depth of
7,500 feet and found 38 feet of net gas pay in a 48-foot gross

working interest in the well. Other owners are a New England
Electric System &lt;NES> unit, with a 25 pct stake, and
Southwestern Energy Production Co, with 15 pct.
