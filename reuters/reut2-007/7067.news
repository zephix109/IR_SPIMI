said a new oil discovery in the Peerless Lake area of

barrels of oil a day from a lower zone and more than 1,500
barrels a day from a separate upper zone.
    Canadian Roxy has a 35 pct interest in the five-year
royalty free well, known as the Canadian Roxy et Al Trout
A14-8-89-3 W5M. Texaco Canada Inc holds 25 pct, MLC Oil and Gas

of the discovery and a seismic program is underway to evaluate
further drilling opportunities.
