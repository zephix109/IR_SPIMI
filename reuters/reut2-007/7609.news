<TITLE>BERLINER BANK SUFFERS LOSSES ON STUTTGART LOANS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WEST BERLIN, March 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Berliner Bank AG> has suffered
losses of between 10 and 100 mln marks through credits granted
by its Stuttgart branch by officials there exceeding their
powers, a bank spokesman said in answer to queries.
    The spokesman declined to say exactly how large the losses
were. Berliner Bank has suspended the three managers of its
Stuttgart branch and is continuing an investigation into the
case, in which state prosecutors are also participating.
    The fact that powers had been exceeded emerged in a routine
check at the branch. The City of West Berlin owns 74 pct of
Berliner Bank and the rest is held by small shareholders.
