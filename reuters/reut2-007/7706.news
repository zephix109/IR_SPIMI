<TITLE>TREASURY'S BAKER SAYS TAX CHEATING UNDETECTED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>Treasury Secretary James Baker told
a Senate Appropriations subcommittee there is still lots of
room for improvement in government programs to crack down on
tax cheating.
    "I think we're far from the point at which we reach
saturation," Baker said when asked at what point additional
efforts to catch cheating become fruitless.
    He said Internal Revenue Service efforts would raise a
projected 41 billion dlrs in fiscal 1988 compared to 18 billion
dlrs in 1981.
    "So we are increasing," Baker said.
