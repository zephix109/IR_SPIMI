<TITLE>SPANISH COAL MINERS CALL STRIKES OVER LAYOFFS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MADRID, March 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>Miners at Spain's state-owned Hulleras
del Norte S.A. (Hunosa) coal company have called a 72-hour
strike starting on Monday to protest against a restructuring
plan that entails layoffs, union sources said.
    They said more stoppages would follow in coming weeks.
    The unions rejected a company compromise proposal to extend
the period of the restructuring plan to four years instead of
two and said there should be no job losses.
    The company wants to shed some 2,000 jobs and start cutting
back on production to help boost productivity by five pct
yearly to the year 2000.
