<TITLE>FORMER REPUBLIC EMPLOYEES GET ESOP FUNDS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MINNEAPOLIS, MINN., March 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>The International
Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers said checks
totaling 33 mln dlrs are being mailed to 2,500 of its members
who formerly worked for Republic Airlines and are now employed
by Northwest Airlines (NWA).
    The payoffs result from a trust agreement and employee
stock ownership plan negotiated in early 1984 by the union to
protect Republic workers when the airline was in financial
difficulty, the union said.
    Republic has since merged with Northwest Airlines.
