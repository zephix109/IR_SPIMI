<TITLE>PROGRESS TOWARD IRAQ-IRAN PEACE SEEN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BAHRAIN, March 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Abdullah
Ibn Abdulaziz said in remarks published today there would be
important progress in the next few months on Arab and Islamic
efforts to end the Iraq-Iran war.
    Prince Abdullah, in an interview with the Kuwait magazine
Al-Majalis, carried by the official Saudi Press Agency (SPA),
said: "Important progress ... Will happen during the coming two
or three months."
    He said, "We have always appealed to the brothers in Iraq
and Iran to stop the bloodshed ... In this meaningless war
between two Islamic countries."
    All international and regional efforts so far to end the
6-1/2-year-old war have failed. Iran says there can be no peace
until Iraqi President Saddam Hussein is ousted.
    Prince Abdullah said Iraq had always responded to Islamic
and Arab peace calls.
