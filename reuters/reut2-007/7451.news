<TITLE>UNITED STEELWORKES SAYS DUE PROCESS DENIED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PITTSBURGH, March 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>The United Steelworkers of America
said that bankruptcy Judge Burton Liflands's refusal to act on
a union lawsuit was "a gross denial of due process for 47,000
retired employees of LTV Steel."
    The union is seeking an injunction that would require LTV
Corp &lt;QLTV> to reinstate 400 dlr monthly supplements to about
7,000 retirees. The union said that the judge, at the request
of the &lt;Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp>, delayed proceedings
until May four. It said the case was originally to have been
heard on February 27.
    The union said LTV stopped making monthly payments in
February after Pension went before Lifland and received
permission to terminate LTV pension plans covering 47,000
retired hourly workers.
