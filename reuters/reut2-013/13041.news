<TITLE>AMERON &lt;AMN> ADOPTS SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MONTEREY PARK, Calif., April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Ameron Inc said its board
adopted a rights plan designed to protect shareholders from
potentially unfair takeover tactics.
    The plan calls for distribution of one right for each of
its outstanding common shares and each right entitles the
holder to buy one/one-hundredth of a share of newly authorized
Series A Junior Participating cumulative Preferred stock at an
exercise price of 55 dlrs, Ameron said.
    It said the rights are exercisable if a group acquires 20
pct or more of its common stock or announces a tender offer for
30 pct or more of its shares.
