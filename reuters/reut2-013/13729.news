<TITLE>U.K. INTERVENTION WHEAT SOLD TO HOME MARKET</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 7 -  </DATELINE><BODY>A total of 14,685 tonnes of British
intervention feed wheat were sold at today's tender for the
home market, the Home Grown Cereals Authority said.
    Bids amounted to 19,115 tonnes against offerings of 31,528.
Prices paid were at, or above, the prevailing intervention feed
wheat price of 120.71 stg per tonne.
    Grain traders said a large part of the tonnage on offer was
in stores, which would mean high transport costs to deficient
areas. The European Commission recently made available 70,000
tonnes for next week's tender.
