<TITLE>YUGOSLAVIAN BANK GETS 90 MLN DLR WORLD BANK LOAN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The World Bank said it approved a 90
mln dlr loan to Yugoslavia's third largest bank to support a
project promoting energy conservation and substituting
lower-cost energy sources for present sources.
    It said the loan consists of a credit line to Ljubljanska
Banka, Ljubljana (LBL), to finance a project expected to
improve industrial competitiveness and reduce energy imports,
easing the country's current balance-of-payments difficulties.
    The Bank said the project will benefit small and
medium-sized industries, primarily in Yugoslavia's Republic of
Slovenia.
    It said 600,000 dlrs of the loan will cover the foreign
exchange costs of consultancy services, equipment and training
abroad for technical and financial personnel.
