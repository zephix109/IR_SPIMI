<TITLE>LME LEAD MIDSESSION FIRMER ON CASH METAL DEMAND</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Trade house pricing purchases of cash
metal at the end of the official ring gave the LME lead market
a firmer tone this morning, dealers said.
    The cash metal price rose from 805.50 up to 807 stg before
the pricing demand was satisfied. The backwardation widened to
around six stg a tonne from three stg yesterday.
    Some buying interest was stimulated for three months
delivery up to 301 stg and the 483 dlrs equivalent but dealers
generally reckoned this was "range trading' and expected
resistance to develop around 305 stg or 485 dlrs.
