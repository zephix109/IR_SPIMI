<TITLE>UNITED WATER &lt;UWR> UNIT RATE CUT APPROVED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HARRINGTON PARK, N.J., April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>United Water Resources
Inc's Hackensack Water Co subsidiary said the New Jersey Board
of Public Utilities has authorized a 5.9 pct cut in its water
rates.
    The company said the cut, which is effective today, is
expected to reduce its revenues by 5.2 mln dlrs a year.
    The company also said it probably will not need to seek
additionalk rate adjustments until the end of 1987. It applied
in January for a decrease of about 2.3 mln dlrs in annual
revenues, equal to about three pct. This was adjusted to
reflect increased water use, and lower power costs and taxes.
