<TITLE>WHITE HOUSE SAYS INTEREST RATES REFLECT MARKET</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The White House said the rise in
interest rates was "unfortunate in a general sense" but reflected
market forces.
    "There's always movement up and down and the basic fact is
that we believe the economy is strong and growing and there
will always be fluctuations in the interest rate, but the
economy is sound and in good shape," spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
said.
    Citibank raised its prime rate by one quarter of a point
and the move was followed by other banks.
