<TITLE>CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICAL &lt;CAAN> SEES FIRST QTR LOSS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BOSTON, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>Cambridge Analytical Associates Inc said
it expects to incur a loss for the first quarter of fiscal 1987
equal to or greater than its loss of 240,697 dlrs for the
fourth quarter ended December 31, 1986.
    Cambridge said it expects revenues for the first quarter to
be approximately the same as those recorded for the fourth
quarter ended December 31, 1986, of 1,025,961 dlrs.
    Cambridge recorded a profit of 2,204 dlrs on revenues of
847,000 dlrs for the first quarter of fiscal 1986, the company
said.
    The company attributed the expected loss to lower than
expected sales from its laboratory and consulting business and
planned major investment in its proprietary treatment
technology.
    The company said winter is traditionally its slowest
season.
