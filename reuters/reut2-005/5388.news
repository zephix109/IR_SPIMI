<TITLE>CANADA MANUFACTURING UTILIZATION RATE RISES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    OTTAWA, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>Utilization of Canadian manufacturing
capacity rose to 77.2 pct in the fourth quarter of 1986 from 77
pct in the third quarter, Statistics Canada said.
    "Although the change was small, this marked the first
quarter since the third quarter of 1985 in which the
utilization rates for manufacturing as a whole rose," the
federal agency said.
    Increased residential construction led to strong increases
in the building materials sector, led by a 3.3 pct increase in
non-metallic mineral industries.
