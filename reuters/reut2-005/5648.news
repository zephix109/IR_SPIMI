<TITLE>NEW EEP DURUM WHEAT OFFER TO ALGERIA -- USDA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 16 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. exporters will have the
opportunity to sell an additional 300,000 tonnes of U.S. durum
wheat to Algeria under the Export Enhancement Program, EEP, the
U.S. Agriculture Department said.
    The department said the sales will be subsidized with
commodities from the Commodity Credit Corporation, CCC,
inventory and the subsidy will enable U.S. exports to compete
at commercial prices in the Algerian market.
    Algeria has already purchased 300,000 tonnes of U.S. durum
wheat under a previous export enhancement initiative announced
November 10, 1986, it said.
