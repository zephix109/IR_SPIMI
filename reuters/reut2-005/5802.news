<TITLE>SYRIA PROPOSES REDUCED BUDGET FOR 1987</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    DAMASCUS, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>The government proposed a 1987 budget
of up to 41.7 billion Syrian pounds, a 4.8 pct decrease from
last year's allocation.
    Finance minister Qahtan Seyoufi told parliament last night
the reduction was due mainly to a cut in investment
allocations.
    Planned recurrent spending of 24.2 billion pounds, almost
unchanged from 1986, took account of national security needs
and "Syria's role in steadfastness and liberation," he said.
    The budget, which is still subject to approval by
parliament and by President Hafez al-Assad, also aims to meet
mounting spending on education, health and essential imports.
    Power and water projects would take up 43.5 pct of
investment allocations of 17.5 billion pounds and agriculture
about 20 pct, Seyoufi said.
    The budget's basic goals were to restrict current spending,
curb inflation and step up reliance on local resources, he
said.
