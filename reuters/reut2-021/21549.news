<TITLE>TDK SALES RISE ON ELECTRONIC PARTS SALES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>TDK Corp &lt;TDK.T> said its sales rose 3.6
pct in the three months ended August 31 due to better sales of
electronic materials and components, which grew 9.2 pct
compared with the same period of 1986.
    Net profit gained only 0.5 pct due to lower interest income
and exchange losses which depressed non-operating income, it
said. It earlier reported net up to 4.20 billion from 4.18
billion in the year earlier period after sales up to 95.96
billion from 92.59 billion. The proportion of overseas sales to
total sales fell to 45.2 pct from 45.6 pct a year earlier due
to lower tape sales to North America.
