<TITLE>CMS &lt;CMS> CITES HIGHER ELECTRIC SALES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    JACKSON, MICH., Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>CMS Energy Corp, parent of
Consumers Power Co, said the fivefold improvement in its third
quarter earnings was the result of higher electric sales.
    The company also cited its ongoing refinancing program
which it said significantly reduced high-cost debt and
preference stock, and capitalized interest on assets which will
be used in the company's Midland cogeneration venture.
    CMS reported quarterly earnings of 56.0 mln dlrs, or 65 cts
a share, up from 8.8 mln dlrs, or 10 cts a share a year
earlier. It said electric sales were up 4.6 pct due to
continued economic growth and warmer than normal weather.
