<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Moody's Investors Service said it
lowered the ratings on 464 mln dlrs of long-term debt issued by
RepublicBank Corp and its two principal subsidiaries but
upgraded 451 mln dlrs of securities of Interfirst Corp &lt;IFC>.
    The rating adjustments are based on the likelihood that the
proposed merger of the two Texas banks will be consummated.

institutions.

downgraded to BA-1 from BAA-1 while Interfirst's was raised to
BA-1 from B-1.
