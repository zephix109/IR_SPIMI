<TITLE>WEST GERMAN COCOA GRINDINGS WITHIN EXPECTATIONS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HAMBURG, April 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>West German first quarter cocoa
grindings, which rose 2.9 pct from the same 1986 quarter, were
within expectations, trade sources said.
    They described the results, announced Saturday, as normal
and unspectacular, considering that the grind in the fourth
quarter was rather high and some was carried over into the
first quarter.
    Grindings rose to 55,190 tonnes from 53,643 in the first
1986 quarter. A spokesman for the Confectionery Industry
Association said that West German grindings are expected to
stay relatively high in comparison to other West European
countries.
