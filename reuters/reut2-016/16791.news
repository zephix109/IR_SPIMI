<TITLE>DOLLAR GENERAL &lt;DOLR.O> MARCH SALES FALL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SCOTTSVILLE, Ky., April 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Dollar General Corp said sales
for March fell 4.6 pct to 43.4 mln dlrs from 45.5 mln dlrs a
year earlier, with same-store sales off 6.9 pct.
    The company said in March 1986, sales were helped by Easter
shopping and a heavier schedule of promotions. Easter falls
April 19 this year, and the company said unseasonably cold and
snowy weather hampered March results this year.
    It said first quarter sales were up seven pct to 114.4 mln
dlrs from 107.0 mln dlrs a year earlier.
