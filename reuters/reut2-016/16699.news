<TITLE>AIR CANADA SETS SERVICE TO EGYPT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MONTREAL, April 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Air Canada, the state-owned airline,
said it plans to begin flights to Egypt next year following a
bilateral air trade agreement signed between the Egyptian and
Canadian governments.
    "Egypt has a healthy passenger and cargo air market in
which Air Canada can be a powerful competitor," executive
vice-president Roger Linder said.
    The airline said it would like to link the service with one
of its European stops.
    It said it plans further expansion with destinations in the
Middle East and Asia and a trans-Pacific route from Canada to
the Far East.
