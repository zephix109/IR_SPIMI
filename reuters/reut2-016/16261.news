<TITLE>BROWNING-FERRIS &lt;BFI> UNIT SEES EPA LAWSUIT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BUFFALO, N.Y., April 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>CECOS International Inc, a
subsidiary of Browning-Ferris Industries Inc, said it expects
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to sue the company,
claiming non-compliance with regulatory requirements at CECOS'
Livingston, Louisiana hazardous waste treatment plant.
    CECOS said the EPA advised the company it intendend to seek
a penalty in the range of five mln dlrs to 10 mln dlrs.
    CECOS said it considered the proposed penalty to be "grossly
excessive" and has offered 125,000 dlrs in earlier negotiations
to settle the disputed issues.
    CECOS said it believes strongly that the EPA's claims and
proposed remedies concerning the Livingston waste disposal site
are unreasonable.
    The company also said its 125,000 dlr settlement offer was
consistent with monetary penalties previously accepted by the
EPA concerning disputes over other hazardous waste treatment,
storage and disposal operations.
    CECOS said major issues of the dispute include the
Livingston waste site's analysis and operation plans,
inspection records and freeboard limits of rainwawater holding
impoundments.
