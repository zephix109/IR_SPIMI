<TITLE>PAKISTAN COMPLAINS ABOUT AFGHAN AIR RAIDS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    UNITED NATIONS, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Pakistan complained to the United
Nations today that planes from Afghanistan attacked Pakistani
villages last Thursday and Friday, killing 90 people and
wounding 230 others.
    "These wanton and barbarous attacks are unprecedented in the
scale of the casualties inflicted and damage caused," Pakistan's
acting U.N. representative Aneesuddin Ahmed said in a letter to
Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar.
    Ahmed, who did not request any specific U.N. action, said
the attacks took place immediately after the start of the
current round of U.N.-sponsored talks on Afghanistan in Geneva
and indicated that "the Kabul regime is deliberately aggravating
tensions and vitiating the prospects of the talks."
