<TITLE>JAPAN HOUSING STARTS RISE IN FEBRUARY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japan's housing starts in February rose
13.4 pct from a year earlier to 109,254, the 10th successive
year-on-year gain, the Construction Ministry said.
    February housing starts were up 16.8 pct from 93,554 in
January when they fell 27.4 pct from a month earlier but rose
10.3 pct from a year earlier.
    Higher housing starts were mainly due to a 26.8 pct
year-on-year rise in apartment building starts to 51,829 for
the 56th consecutive gain, spurred primarily by lower domestic
interest rates.
