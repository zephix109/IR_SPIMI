<TITLE>INNOVEX &lt;INVX> COMPLETES PURCHASE OF LUCHT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MINNEAPOLIS, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>Innovex  Inc said it has completed
the purchase of substantially of the interest in Lucht
Engineering Inc that it did not already own.
    Prior to this move Innovex owned 79 pct of Lucht, the
company said.
    Innovex said it bought the shares by exchanging 293,101
shares of unregistered Innovex common stock. Innovex president,
Thomas Haley, said the exchange is non-dilutive and will cause
a slight increase in Innovex's fully diluted earnings per share
during the last half of fiscal 1987.
    Lucht will continue to function as a unit of Innovex,
Innovex said.
