<TITLE>THREE SENATORS SEEN ADDED TO SENATE FARM PANEL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. Senate Agriculture Committee
chairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) said three senators probably
would be added to the panel in the next week.
    Sen. David Karnes, the Nebraska Republican recently
appointed to replace the deceased Democrat Edward Zorinsky,
probably will join the minority side, Leahy told the National
Cattlemen's Association.
    The committee chairman said he would like to have Sen. John
Breaux (D-La.) join the majority.
    Leahy would not say who would be the other Democrat to join
the committee, which with the new members would be split 11
Democrats to nine Republicans. Sen. James Exon (D-Neb.) is
known to have expressed an interest in joining the panel.
