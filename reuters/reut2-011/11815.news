<TITLE>U.K. INTERVENTION FEED WHEAT TENDER RESULT AWAITED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Grain traders said they were still
awaiting results of yesterday's U.K. Intervention feed wheat
tender for the home market.
    The market sought to buy 340,000 tonnes, more than double
the remaining 150,000 tonnes available under the current
tender. However, some of the tonnage included duplicate bids
for supplies in the same stores.
    Since the tenders started last July 861,000 tonnes of
British feed wheat have been sold back to the home market.
