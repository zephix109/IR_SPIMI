<TITLE>EC MINISTERS EXTEND BEEF, MILK MARKETING YEARS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>European Community agriculture
ministers agreed to extend the 1986/87 milk and beef marketing
years to the end of May, Belgian minister Paul de Keersmaeker
told a news conference.
    He said the reason for the two-month extension of the only
EC farm product marketing years which end during the spring
months was that it would be impossible for ministers formally
to agree 1987/88 farm price arrangements before May 12.
    This is when the European Parliament is due to deliver its
opinion on price proposals from the EC Commission.
