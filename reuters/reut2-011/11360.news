<TITLE>FIAT EXPECTS SHARP 1987 SALES GROWTH</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TURIN, Italy, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>Fiat SpA &lt;FIAT.MI> expects its
consolidated group sales to reach 37,000 to 38,000 billion lire
in 1987 against a provisional 29,020 billion lire announced for
1986, managing director Cesare Romiti said.
    Romiti, speaking at a meeting of industrial managers and
engineering students, said the expected sales growth partly
reflected recent acqusitions such as that of &lt;Alfa-Romeo SpA>.
    Alfa Romeo was acquired late last year and merged with
Fiat's Lancia unit to form a new company, Alfa-Lancia
Industriale Spa &lt;ALFI.MI>.
