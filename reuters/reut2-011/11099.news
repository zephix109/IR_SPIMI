<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 30 - </DATELINE><BODY>Time Inc said its wholly-owned

10-3/4 pct guaranteed notes due January 26, 1990.
    The redemption date is May 5, 1987, it said. The notes will
be redeemed at 101.5 pct of their principal amount, plus
accrued interest through the redemption date.
