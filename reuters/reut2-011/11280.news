<TITLE>GERMAN INDUSTRY SEES GROWTH CONTINUING SLUGGISH</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    COLOGNE, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>The West German economy is expected to
continue to grow at low levels despite a marked slowing of
expansive forces in early 1987, the German Industry Association
(BDI) said.
    A BDI statement warned, however, that a sense of proportion
in 1987 wage settlements was necessary to ensure that growth
was preserved.
    Union representatives and employers in the key engineering
industry are currently negotiating on 1987's and union claims
for a shorter working week. Last week public sector employees
received a 3.4 pct wage rise retroactive from January 1.
