<TITLE>U.K. MONEY MARKET OFFERED EARLY ASSISTANCE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bank of England said it had invited
an early round of bill offers from the discount houses after
forecasting a shortage of around 1.2 billion stg in the money
market today.
    Among the main factors affecting liquidity, bills for
repurchase by the market will drain some 526 mln stg while
bills maturing in official hands and the take-up of treasury
bills will remove around 1.79 billion stg. A rise in note
circulation will take out a further 105 mln stg.
    Partly offsetting these outflows, exchequer transactions
will add around 1.01 billion stg and bankers' balances above
target some 185 mln stg.
