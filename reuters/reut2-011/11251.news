<TITLE>HAPAG ORDERS NEW CONTAINER SHIP FROM CHINA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HAMBURG, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Hapag Lloyd AG> said it ordered a new
container vessel from China for its Australia service.
    The order was given to the &lt;Hudong shipyards> in Shanghai
after lengthy negotiations with West German shipbuilders, the
company said in a statement.
    The Chinese firm offered to build the vessel at over 30 mln
marks less than West German yards, despite government subsidies
which Bonn pays its ailing shipbuilding industry, Hapag said. A
company spokesman would not comment on the total order value
but said the new vessel would replace the 33,333 dwt Sydney
Express in 1989 and would carry 2,700 container units.
