<TITLE>SOUTH KOREA TO RESIST CURRENCY REVALUATION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SEOUL, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>South Korean Finance Minister Chung
In-yong will resist pressure for a currency revaluation to cut
South Korea's trade surplus with the United States when he
meets Treasury Secretary James Baker next week, Finance
Ministry officials said.
    They said Chung would leave Monday to attend the
International Monetary Fund's Interim Committee meeting and to
hold talks with Baker and other U.S. officials on ways to
reduce the surplus.
    The April 9 committee meeting is expected to review the
agreement by six industrialized nations in Paris last month
that newly-industrialized countries, such as South Korea and
Taiwan, should allow their currencies to increase in value.
