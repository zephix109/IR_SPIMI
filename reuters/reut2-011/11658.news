<TITLE>U.S. OFFICIAL SEES EVIDENCE OF EXPORT GROWTH</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>Beryl Sprinkel, chairman of the
White House Council of Economic Advisers, said he sees "growing
but incomplete evidence that (U.S.) export volumes are finally
strengthening."
    In remarks prepared for a speech today in Los Angeles,
Sprinkel said the decline in the dollar's value since 1985 had
"largely" restored U.S. cost competitiveness in world markets and
appeared to signal an end to U.S. trade imbalances.
    "I am confident that further improvements in our trade
performance will contribute significantly to U.S. growth in
1987," he said.
