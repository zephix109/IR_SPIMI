<TITLE>U.S. WEATHER/COTTON SUMMARY -- USDA/NOAA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>Cotton planting began in California
and was expected to proceed rapidly in the week ended March 28,
the Joint Agriculture Weather Facility of the U.S. Agriculture
and Commerce Departments said.
    In a summary of its Weather and Crops Bulletin, the agency
said winds and low soil temperature retarded growth and
hampered seeding in Arizona.
    Planting moved into Mohave and Pinal Counties.
    Cotton planting progressed well in the Lower Valley,
Coastal Bend and along the Upper Coast of Texas.
    However, bad weather continued hampering cotton seedbed
preparations in Oklahoma.
