<TITLE>U.S. GROUP ASKS SPECIAL ROYAL DUTCH&lt;RD> MEETING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 30 - </DATELINE><BODY>A group of U.S. investors opposed to
Royal Dutch Shell Petroleum Co's South African policies plans
to seek a special shareholders meeting to discuss their
complaints.
    Representatives of the American Baptist Churches and the
New York City Teachers Retirement System said the company has
refused to include their proposals in proxy material prepared
for the annual meeting in May.
    The group said its proposals call for an end to sales by
Royal Dutch to the South African police and military and
withdrawal from South Africa.
