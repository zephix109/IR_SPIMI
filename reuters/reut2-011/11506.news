<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 31 - </DATELINE><BODY>Pennzoil Co Chairman J. Hugh Liedtke
told a meeting of analysts that the company expects its first
quarter net to be down considerably, before an unusual item,
from the loss of 49 cts a share reported a year ago.

"We're still closing our books on the first quarter, so I don't
have final numbers for you," he said.
