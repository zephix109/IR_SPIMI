<DATELINE>    Caracas, june 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>venezuela may turn to the international
monetary fund for credits as part of the country's overall
effort to reestablish financial flows from abroad, finance
minister manuel azpurua said today.
    "this is no secret. It's just one of the steps the executive
has begun taking to reestablish financial flows to the country,"
azpurua told reporters at the finance ministry.
    He did not specify what types of loans venezuela would seek
from the fund or the amounts involved.

gathering data for its annual report on the venezuelan economy,
the finance minstry said. Members of the mission met today with
officials from the ministry's public finance department.
    Venezuela is one of the few latin american debtors which

imf since the region's financial crisis began in 1982.

billion dollars), according to the fund's 1986 report.
