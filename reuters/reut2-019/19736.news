<TITLE>NATIONAL PATENT &lt;NPD> TO START AIDS DRUG TRIAL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, June 29, - </DATELINE><BODY>National Patent Development Corp and
Bar-Ilan University of Israel said that their joint venture
corporation, Scientific Testing Inc, will begin a clinical
trial in the U.S. of its immuno-augmenting compound, AS101, for
the treatment of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS).
    The study will be conducted at the Institute of
Immunological Disorders (MD Anderson Hospital, Houston, Tex)
under the direction of Dr Peter Mensell, pursuant to an
investigational new drug application filed with the Food and
Drug Administration, the company said.
    The study, expected to begin in four to six weeks, is
designed to test the effects of AS101 on about 30 AIDS
patients, National Patent said.
    It added that AS101, a proprietary synthetic compound
invented by Bar-Ilan University doctors, has shown
immuno-augmenting, anti-viral and anti-tumor activity in
preclinical animal testing, and immuno-augmenting activity in a
limited number of AIDS patients in phase one foreign clinical
tests.
