<TITLE>SANTOS SAYS IT HAS SIGNIFICANT OIL FIND</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ADELAIDE, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>Santos Ltd &lt;STOS.S> said it had made a
significant oil discovery at its Mawson One well in the Moomba
block of the Cooper Basin, South Australia.
    It said the well flowed oil from sands at an average rate
of 1,440 barrels per day from 2,131 to 2,135 metres through a
6mm choke.
    Santos said the well was cased and suspended pending
further evaluation. But it said the proximity of the discovery
to existing production facilities at the Gidgealpa South field
would allow Mawson One to be brought into production rapidly.
    Santos has a 60 pct stake in the block, &lt;Delhi Petroleum
Pty Ltd> has 30 pct and &lt;South Australian Oil and Gas Corp Pty
Ltd> has 10 pct.
