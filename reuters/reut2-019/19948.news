<DATELINE>     DALLAS, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>First RepublicBank Corp said it will add
325 mln dlrs to its loan loss reserve for the second quarter.
     The company said the move, which is being made to cover
loans to developed countries, will result in a loss of around
313 mln dlrs in the second quarter ending June 30.
    First RepublicBank Corp said the increase in its loan loss
reserve will lead to a loss for the full year. Figures for last

its reserve to 1.1 billion dlrs, out of which it will allocate
275 mln dlrs to cover its loans to 18 developing countries.

action taken by other major banking organizations on developing
country loans.
