<TITLE>JAGUAR PLANS ONE BILLION STG OUTLAY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>Jaguar Plc &lt;JAGR.L> will spend about one
billion stg over the next six years on expanded production,
automation and improved efficiency, Jaguar chairman Sir John
Egan said.
    He told reporters the company planned to raise production
to around 80,000 cars a year by 1992 from 47,000 this year,
while productivity was expected to rise to 5.5 cars per worker
in 1990 compared with four cars now.
    Egan said the XJ6 model introduced last October was the
first of a new saloon car family. Jaguar planned to bring out a
new sports car in the early 1990s, probably called the "F."
