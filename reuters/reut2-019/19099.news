<TITLE>KING WORLD &lt;KWP> STARTS BID FOR OWN SHARES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>King World Productions Inc said it has
started a tender offer for up to 4,100,000 of its own common
shares at 28 dlrs each.
    In a newspaper advertisement, the company said the offer,
proration period and withdrawal rights expire July 17 unless
extended. The offer is not conditioned on receipt of any
minimum number of shares.
    King World said members of the King family and an officer
and director who together own about 46 pct of its stock have
agreed not to tender any shares in the offer but to sell up to
3,465,085 shares to King in January 1988 at 28 dlrs each.
    King World has about 30.8 mln shares outstanding.
    The company said a tendering shareholder may elect to
receive payment for his shares in January rather than
immediately for tax purposes.  King said it will pay only the
offer price and no interest.
