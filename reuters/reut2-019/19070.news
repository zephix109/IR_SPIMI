<TITLE>SPAIN'S PRIVATE BANK STAFF STRIKE, IMPACT UNCLEAR</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MADRID, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Spain's private bank staff started a one
and a half day strike over wage demands but its impact was not
yet clear.
    Spokesmen for several of the main banks said strikers at
their Madrid headquarters appeared to be a small minority. They
had yet to receive reports from branches.
    Unions called out the 160,000 employees to press for cuts
in working hours and an eight pct wage rise. Banks implemented
a 4.75 pct wage increase last month.
