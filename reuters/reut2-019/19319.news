<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Continental Illinois Corp will add to
its reserves against bad loans from less developed countries
when its board meets next week, E.F. Hutton analyst Fred Meinke

    Meinke said a Continental executive told him Friday the
banking firm, parent of Continental Illinois National Bank and
Trust Co of Chicago, will add to its reserves next week along
the lines of what other banks have been doing since Citicorp
&lt;CCI> initiated the provisioning last month.
    Continental Illinois has about 2.6 billion dlrs in loans to
Latin American countries.
    Meinke said he thinks Continental Illinois will add about
25 pct or more of its Latin American exposure to its loss
reserve, or about 650 mln dlrs or more.
    "They have a big reserve already. My guess this will be on
top of that," he said.
