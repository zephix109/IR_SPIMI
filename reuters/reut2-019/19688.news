<TITLE>VIDEO JUKEBOX &lt;JUKE.O> SETS PURCHASE EXTENSION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MIAMI, June 29 - </DATELINE><BODY>Video Jukebox Network Inc said it has
extended through July two the exclusive period provided in its

Steven A. Peters.
    Video said it currently has 7,525,000 common shares
outstanding.

&lt;Venture W Inc>, an investment firm; Mark Blank, president of
&lt;National Brands Inc>; J. Patrick Michaels, Jr., president and
chief executive officer of &lt;Communications Equity Associates
Inc>; and CEA Investors Partnerships II, a company Michaels
would form for the purchase, Video said.

them to purchase two mln shares for 1,750,000 dlrs plus the
initial option purchase price of 250,000 dlrs.
