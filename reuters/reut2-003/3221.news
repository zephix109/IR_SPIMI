<DATELINE>    ATLANTA, March 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Oglethorpe Power Corp said it does not
plan to raise its electric rates to cover higher construction
costs at the Alvin W. Vogtle Nuclear Plant, in which Oglethorpe
holds a 30 pct interest.
    Earlier today, Southern Co's &lt;SO> Georgia Power Co said it
raised the estimated cost of building the plant by nearly six
