<TITLE>WISCONSIN PUBLIC SERVICE &lt;WPS> RAISES BUDGET</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    GREEN BAY, WIS., March 11 - </DATELINE><BODY>Wisconsin Public Service Corp
said in its annual report the company's five-year construction
program, 1987 through 1991, is projected at 330 mln dlrs.
    It said the amount, which includes about 4.0 mln dlrs for
sulfur dioxide controls at company power plants, is 42 mln dlrs
more than the previous five-year period.
    Wisconsin Public Service also said natural gas sales
dropped 22 pct, mainly because of the growing trend of large
industrial customers to purchase gas directly from producers.
