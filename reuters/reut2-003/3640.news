<TITLE>CANADA DECEMBER LEADING INDICATOR UP 0.4 PCT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    OTTAWA, March 11 - </DATELINE><BODY>Canada's leading composite indicator
advanced 0.4 pct in December after gaining 0.4 pct in the two
previous months, Statistics Canada said.
    The unfiltered index rose 0.8 pct in the month, a
turnaround from the 0.3 pct decline in November, the federal
agency said.
    The manufacturing groups continued to post advances while
goods production rose 1.6 pct, the third increase in the last
four months. The advances, however, were offset by a
deceleration in household demand.
