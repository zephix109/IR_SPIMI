<TITLE>FUJITSU MAY ASSEMBLE ITS OWN COMPUTERS IN U.S.</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 11 - </DATELINE><BODY>Fujitsu Ltd &lt;ITSU.T> may assemble
computers in Oregon for sale in the United States under the
Fujitsu brand name, a company spokesman said.
    He said the rising value of the yen against the dollar has
virtually erased the wage differential between the two
countries and Fujitsu would like to make the medium-size,
multi-functional business computers in the United States.
    The Oregon plant, owned by Fujitsu subsidiary, &lt;Fujitsu
America Inc>, now makes magnetic computer discs and will soon
make printers. Fujitsu Ltd also has a licensing agreement to
make Amdahl Corp &lt;AMH> computers for sale in the U.S.
