<TITLE>SINGAPORE COURT ADJOURNS BRUNEI BANK JUDGEMENT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SINGAPORE, March 11 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Singapore High Court has
adjourned summary judgement for the second time on a &lt;National
Bank of Brunei Bhd> case for loan repayments from Khoo Teck
Puat and 15 associated companies, court sources said.
    The case will be heard again on May 4, when a summary
judgement will decide if the civil case should proceed.
    Khoo owned most of the bank's equity before it was closed
in November by the Brunei government after some of its
officials were charged with mismanagement.
    The bank, now controlled by Brunei, is seeking repayment of
about 900 mln Singapore dlrs in loans guaranteed by Khoo.
