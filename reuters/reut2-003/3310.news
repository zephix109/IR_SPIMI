<TITLE>LCE AND IPE ELECT FIRST TRADED OPTIONS MEMBERS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The first 23 members have been elected to
the joint traded options facility of the London Commodity
Exchange (LCE) and the International Petroleum exchange (IPE),
the exchanges said in a statement.
    More firms have applied and the final tranche will be
admitted on April one and trading is planned to start in early
June on the new trading floor on Commodity Quay.
    Traded options need a volatile and liquid futures base to
succeed and chairman of the joint formation committee Jack
Patterson said the existing LCE cocoa, coffee, sugar and IPE
gas oil contracts should have no difficulty in providing this.
