<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 11 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Russo Securities Inc> said in a
statement it acted as a broker executing unsolicited orders for
an individual named in a Securities and Exchange Commission

who allegedly traded on inside information from Nahum
Vaskevitch, head of Merrill Lynch and Co's &lt;MER> London mergers
