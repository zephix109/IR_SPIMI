<TITLE>AERO SERVICES &lt;AEROE> SEES BETTER 1987</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TETERBORO, N.J., March 11 - </DATELINE><BODY>Aero Services International Inc
said it expects to achieve improvements in overall operations
in the year ending September 30, 1987.
    Earlier, Aero reported a 1986 year end net loss of 3.0 mln
dlrs compared to a profit of 483,000 dlrs in 1985.
    The company said the loss was attributable to costs
associated with its acquisition costs and operating losses of
nine Beckett Aviation fixed base operations purchased in August
1985 and discontinued weather service and flight simulator
segments.
