<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Ranks Hovis McDougall Plc &lt;RHML.L> said
it was making an increased and final offer for the Avana Group

new Rank Hovis shares for every five Avana ordinary shares,
valuing each Avana share at 829p.

receive Ranks Hovis's forecast net interim dividend of 2.65p
