<DATELINE>    KANSAS CITY, Mo., April 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Utilicorp United Inc said its
management is recommending to the board of directors a
three-for-two stock split and an increase in the quarterly cash
dividend rate, currently at 37 cts per common share.
    The company said it is also submitting to shareholders at
its May 21 annual meeting a proposal authorizing an additional
class of common stock.
    Utilicorp said the board of directors will vote on the
split at its next regularly scheduled board meeting on May 6.

investments, acquisitions or for other corporate purposes.
