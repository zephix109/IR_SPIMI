<TITLE>CARGILL U.K. STRIKE TALKS BREAK OFF WITHOUT RESULT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Two days of talks between management and
unions to try to end the 3-1/2 month labour dispute at Cargill
U.K. Ltd's oilseed crushing plant at Seaforth ended yesterday
without resolving the situation, a company spokesman said.
    Fresh talks are expected to be held early next week but the
actual date has not yet been fixed, he added.
    Oilseed processing at the mill has been at a standstill
since December 19 and the company has declared force majeure
for deliveries of soymeal and soyoil ahead to May.
