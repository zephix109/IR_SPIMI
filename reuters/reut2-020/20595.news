<TITLE>SCOTT CABLE &lt;JSCC> DEBT DOWNGRADED BY MOODY'S</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>Moody's Investors Service Inc said it
downgraded about 50 mln dlrs of subordinated debentures to B-3
from B-2 of Scott Cable Communications Inc.
    Moody's cited the significant increase in leverage and the
reduction in coverages that will result from the merger of
Scott with Simmons Communications Merger Corp.
    Scott lacks sufficient operating cash flow to fund the
entire interest expense for the near term and will depend on
bank financing to make up any shortfall, the agency noted.
    It added that the B-3 rating recognizes operating
efficiencies that will result from the merger.
