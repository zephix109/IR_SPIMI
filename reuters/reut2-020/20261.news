<DATELINE>    DAR ES SALAAM, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>Two large container cranes donated
by the Danish International Development Agency (DANIDA) have
arrived in Dar es Salaam where they will help to increase the

crane already installed in the port, which is an important
trade outlet for Tanzania, Zambia, Malawi and eastern Zaire.
