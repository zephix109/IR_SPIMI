<TITLE>WHITE HOUSE TAKES WAIT-AND-SEE STANCE ON STOCKS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>The White House took a wait-and-see
attitude toward the stock market crisis, barring "precipitous
action" to deal with it.
    Referring to news reports, White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater said, "It seems most of the world economists are
uncertain as to the specific causes, so we'll just have to wait
and see if there's a rebound today."
    "We certainly don't want to take precipitous action," the
spokesman added.
    "No meetings are scheduled at this time. We'll monitor the
situation and see how the markets respond today," he said.
