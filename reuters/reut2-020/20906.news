<TITLE>AMCA INTERNATIONAL &lt;AIL> SEES 4TH QTR PROFIT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TORONTO, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>AMCA International said it expects to
earn a profit in the fourth quarter which will exceed the third
quarter result.
    The company earned 4.9 mln dlrs in the third quarter
against a year earlier loss of 56.2 mln. However, after the
payment of preferred dividends it lost two cents per share from
a loss of 1.79 dlrs per share last year.
    In the 1986 fourth quarter, the company had an operating
loss of 4.9 mln dlrs, or 98 cents per share. It said its
positive outlook was based on expected debt bill reduction and
an improved backlog of orders.
    The company also said its board approved a decision to sell
its Manitoba Rolling Mills. It did not elaborate.
