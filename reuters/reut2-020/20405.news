<TITLE>AUDIO/VIDEO AFFILIATES &lt;AVA> TO PURCHASE SHARES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    DAYTON, Ohio, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>Audio/Video Affiliates Inc said it
has authorized the purchase of up to 2.5 mln shares of its
common stock, in market transactions, from time to time.
    The company said the purchases were authorized because it

held in the company's treasury, for possible future use.
