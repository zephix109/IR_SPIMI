<TITLE>INRO COUNCIL MEETING ADJOURNED UNTIL THURSDAY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>A Council meeting of the
International Natural Rubber Organization (INRO) has been
adjourned until Thursday as tomorrow is a Malaysian national
holiday, officials of the organisation said.
    The main issue at the talks, which opened here yesterday,
has been the INRO buffer stock and the manner in which the
buffer stock manager should continue to sell rubber after the
current international pact for the commodity expires on October
22, they said.
    The deadline for the start of the new pact is January 1989.
    Buffer stock manager Aldo Hofmeister has been mandated to
continue selling rubber during the interim period.
    Other issues discussed include ratification of the new
accord, the officials said.
    Only Malaysia of the pact's 32 producing and consuming
member countries had ratified the new agreement by the
beginning of this month.
    The meeting is due to end on Thursday.
