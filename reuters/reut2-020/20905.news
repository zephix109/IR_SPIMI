<TITLE>MEDIA GENERAL &lt;MEGA> FAMILY WONT SELL SHARES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    RICHMOND, Va., Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Media General Inc's chairman, D.
Tennant Bryant, said his family would not sell its controlling
share block, so it would be impossible for an investor group
led by &lt;Giant Group Ltd> to gain control of the company.
    The investor group, which includes Barris Industries
&lt;BRRS.O>, recently reported that it acquired a 9.8 pct stake of
Media General's class A shares and might seek control.
    Bryant said the company's class A stock elects only 30 pct
of the board, with the remaining 70 pct being elected by class
B shares, two-thirds of which are controlled by the Bryant
family trust, which has no intention of selling its shares.
