<TITLE>PIONEER COMMUNICATIONS &lt;SOAP.O> DROPS NEW TITLES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ROCKY HILL, Conn., Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>Pioneer Communications Network
Inc said it has temporarily suspended printing new titles for
its Soaps and Serials line of paperback books and will now
print only those titles that have demonstrated a profitable
sales history.
    It said it will no longer sell the entire Soaps and Serials
line as a unit but will take orders for individual titles.
    The company said it currently has enough licensor-approved
manuscripts to provide, after publication, for at least six
months of retail operations.
