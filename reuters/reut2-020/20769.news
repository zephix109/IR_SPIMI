<TITLE>REAGAN SEES ROOM FOR INTEREST RATE DECLINES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>President Reagan said he was pleased
with the actions of some banks to reduce their prime lending
rates today and said he sees room for a further decline in
interest rates.
    "I believe there is room in the market for a further decline
in interest rates," Reagan said in a statement as he left the
White House to visit his wife Nancy at Bethesda Naval Hospital.
    Reagan's statement followed a meeting with his top economic
advisers.
    Reagan said he remains concerned about the market, but that
actions taken by the Federal Reserve have helped.
    "Interest rates are down across the spectrum," Reagan said.
    "Specifically, I am pleased that the bond market is strong
and that foreign exchange markets are stable," Reagan said.
