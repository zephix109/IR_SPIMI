<TITLE>GOODMAN FIELDER HAS 29.9 PCT OF RANKS HOVIS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>Goodman Fielder Ltd &lt;GOOW.S> of Australia
said in a statement that it had acquired 31 mln ordinary shares
in Ranks Hovis McDougall Plc &lt;RHML.L> (RHM), bringing its stake
in the company to 29.9 pct or 101 mln ordinary shares.
    Goodman said it has no intention of making a full bid for
the company and would not contemplate doing so over the next
six months in the absence of a material change in the
circumstances of Ranks.
    RHM said it regards the stake build-up as a hostile move
which is unwelcome and not in the long term interest of
shareholders.
