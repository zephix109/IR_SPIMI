<TITLE>G-7 MEETING UNLIKELY - ITALIAN TREASURY OFFICIAL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ROME, Oct 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>A senior treasury ministry official said an
early meeting of Group of Seven (G-7) finance ministers was
unlikely following the sharp fall in stock markets around the
world.
    "I do not think a G-7 meeting is imminent, because the
agreements made at the last meeting at the end of September in
Washington remain valid," Antonio Pedone, economic adviser to
Treasury Minister Giuliano Amato, said in an interview on
Italian state radio.
