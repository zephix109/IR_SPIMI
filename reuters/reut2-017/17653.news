<TITLE>JUDGE REDUCES JURY AWARD TO COASTAL &lt;CGP></TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHEYENNE, Wyo., June 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Coastal Corp said a federal
district court judge has upheld a trial jury's judgment against
a Occidental Petroleum Corp &lt;OXY> subsidiary but reduced the
amount awarded a Coastal subsidiary to 412 mln dlrs from 549
mln dlrs.
    The company said Judge Clarence A. Brimmer denied all
post-trial motions by Occidental's Natural Gas Pipeline Co of
America but did eliminate the trebling of a portion of the
damages for future lost profits and part of the damages for
interference with a contract awarded by the jury in the
antitrust case last October.
   
    An Occidental spokesman said the company has previously
said it will take the case to the federal appeals court which
has previously upheld the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
regulations Natural Gas Pipeline was following in its dealings
with Coastal's Colorado Interstate pipeline subsidiary and
Union Pacific Corp &lt;UNP> Champlin Petroleum Co subsidiary.
