<TITLE>BELL CANADA PLANS LONG DISTANCE TOLL CUT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    OTTAWA, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Bell Canada, a unit of Bell Canada
Enterprises Inc &lt;BCE>, said it applied for an average eight pct
cut in Canadian long distance rates.
    The application to the Canadian Radio-television and
Telecommunications Commission would also reduce the initial
period for operated-assisted calls from three minutes to one
minute and operator- and customer-dialed calls would be charged
the same.
    The billing of operator-assisted calls would include a
conection charge, however. The new rate structure is similar to
schedules announced by Bell January 1 for calls within Ontario,
Quebec and parts of the Northwest Territories, it said.
