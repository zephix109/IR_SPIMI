<TITLE>NEW POLL PUTS BRITISH CONSERVATIVES WELL AHEAD</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 27 - </DATELINE><BODY>Britain's ruling Conservatives
maintained a commanding lead in a new opinion poll, reinforcing
views that Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher is poised to call a
general election in June.
    The Harris poll published in the Observer newspaper gave
the Conservatives the support of 42 pct of those questioned,
Labour 31 pct, and the Liberal-Social Democratic Alliance
trailing with 25 pct.
    This would give the Conservatives a 94-seat overall
majority in the House of Commons.
