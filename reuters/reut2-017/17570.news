<DATELINE>    ROCHESTER, N.Y., June 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Gleason Corp's subsidiary,
Gleason Power Systems, said its Torsen torque-sensing
differential will be supplied as standard equipment in the new
Audi 90 Quattro four-wheel drive vehicle.
    Initial Torsen differential production for the new Audi 90
will not affect earnings in 1987, Gleason said.

the U.S. in late 1987, the company said.
