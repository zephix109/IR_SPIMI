<TITLE>WOODSTREAM &lt;WOD> SEES SECOND QUARTER LOSS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LITITZ, Pa., June 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Woodstream Corp said it expects a
second quarter loss on sales below those of a year earlier.
    In last year's second quarter, Woodstream earned 349,000
dlrs on sales of 13.1 mln dlrs.
    The company said it is seeking to reduce expenses and boost
sales.  It said it is scaling back California fishing rod
operations to cut overhead expenses anbd minimize losses.
    Woodstream said its fishing technologies group is
experieincing significantly higher selling, promotion and
factory expenses, while fishing product sales have fallen due
to inventory corrections by several major customers.
    It said sales of its color liquid display fish/depth finder
are expected to exceed three mln dlrs in the first half but
will be substantially less than expected.
