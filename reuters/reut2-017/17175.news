<TITLE>ATCOR INC &lt;ATCO.O> TO CONTEST ANTITRUST RULING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HARVEY, Ill., April 24 - </DATELINE><BODY>Atcor Inc said a Federal Court has
reinstated a 1986 jury verdict against it and in favor of
Indian Head Inc for antitrust damages of 3.8 mln dlrs before
trebling and attorneys' fees.
    The company said it will challenge the ruling by the United
States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit which reversed a
decision of the District Court in its favor.
    The case involved charges that Atcor acted improperly in
opposing Indian Head's attempt to have its plastic electrical
conduit sanctioned by the National Fire Protection Association
under the 1981 National Electrical Code, it said.
    Atcor said the ruling by the three-judge panel of the Court
of Appeal was incorrect and "seriously questionable in light of
established Supreme Court doctrine".
    The legal avenues to be examined in an attempt to have the
ruling reversed could include filing a petition for Supreme
Court review, the company added.
