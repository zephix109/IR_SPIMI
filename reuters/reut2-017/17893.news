<TITLE>UK CONSERVATIVES LEAD LABOUR BY SEVEN POINTS, POLL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's
Conservatives lead the opposition Labour party by seven
percentage points in the June 11 election campaign, according
to a public opinion poll today.
    The Harris poll on the TV-AM breakfast television show gave
Thatcher's Conservative Party 42 pct, Labour 35 pct and the
centrist Alliance 21 pct.
    This was a one point drop for the Conservatives and one
point rise for the Alliance since the same organisation's
survey yesterday.
    However, a Marplan poll in the Today newspaper had the
Conservatives 11 points ahead. It gave them 44 pct, Labour 33
pct and the Alliance 21 pct.
    All poll results since the campaign began have shown the
Conservatives in the lead. An aggregate of recent surveys
showed they held a nine to 10 point lead over Labour, enough
for a comfortable election victory.
