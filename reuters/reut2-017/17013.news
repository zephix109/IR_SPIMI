<TITLE>NEW YORK TIMES &lt;NYT> SEES UNEVEN GAINS IN 1987</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HUNTSVILLE, Ala., April 21 - </DATELINE><BODY>The New York Times Co said
that if prevailing business conditions continue, the company
sees "another outstanding year, although the remaining quarters
of 1987 will probably not show uniform gains."
    The company's first quarter earnings rose 21 pct to 41.1
mln dlrs or 50 cts a share compared to 33.9 mln dlrs or 42 cts
a share in the year-ago quarter restated for a two-for-one
stock split.
   
    The company also said its newspaper division, which
includes the New York Times and 32 regional newspapers, had a
first quarter operating profit of 69.8 mln dlrs compared with
60.7 mln dlrs in the year-ago first quarter mainly due to
advertising volume and rate increases.
    The company's magazine division, which includes "Family
Circle," had a first quarter profit of 9.7 mln dlrs compared to
7.4 mln dlrs in the year ago quarter.
    The company's broadcasting and cable tv group reported an
operating profit of 2.9 mln dlrs compared to 2.6 mln dlrs in
the year-ago first quarter.
